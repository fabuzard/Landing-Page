Responsive Landing Page 🚀
I created a responsive Landing Page using HTML and Tailwind CSS, designed with the Anima App. This project is fully responsive, ensuring seamless user experiences on both desktop and mobile devices.

✨ Project Overview
This project is based on a beautifully designed Figma file. The design has been translated into clean, maintainable code with a focus on modern web development practices. It's an excellent example of how to leverage Tailwind CSS to create visually appealing and responsive layouts.
